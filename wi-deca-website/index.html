      <p>Your future starts here! At Collegiate DECA, prepare for your career, join a community, compete in over
        twenty-five events, and discover new places! DECA is an organization for everyone. No matter what major
        you are, what background you are, it's for you! Why should you join DECA? Well, to get career-ready, of
        course. I came in here, not as a business major, but I've learned and grown in my business skills and I'm
        hoping to take these skills into the rest of my life. Networking and meeting new people is a great way to
        actually expand my skillset when it comes to the future and DECA has actually given me that opportunity
        to do that. The people in DECA is what made everything. DECA provided me with likeminded individuals that
        helped me grow and contribute by giving back to my community. This is the dream for a competitive person.
        I fell in love with competitions because I could be creative, but I could still learn business competitively.
        Collegiate DECA is awesome because of the travel opportunities where you can travel and make friends with the
        students you're traveling with outside of the classroom. Being able to travel to new places and exploring
        new cultures has been such an amazing opportunity. Something that draws me to DECA is the opportunity for 
        growth. It enhances me as a person. I would not be the person I am today, nor have the confidence that I do
        today if it weren't for DECA. Once you become part of DECA community itself, you will understand that it is 
        all together an experience that you will never get from joining any other organization. What are you waiting
        for? Join Collegiate DECA!
